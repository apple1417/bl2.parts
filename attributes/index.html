    <h1>Attribute Reference</h1>
    <div class="text">
        This page lists all the attributes that the various part pages refer to, what they control, and what exactly happens when a bonus makes their value larger (more positive).
        You can assume all attributes use positive values unless stated otherwise.
        <br>
        Attributes are sorted based on what object they're stored on - this has minor implications on calculation order but can usually be ignored.
        <br>
        Note that these lists are not exhaustive, but should cover all the attributes present in the current parts guides.
        <br>
        Also see the <a href="/bl2/accuracy">Accuracy Mechanics</a> page for a more detailed overview of the various accuracy attributes (including how Hyperion works),
        and the <a href="/bl2/melee">Melee Damage</a> page for how the various melee attributes are combined.
