# Attribute Reference
This page lists all the attributes that the various part pages refer to, what they control, and what
exactly happens when a bonus makes their value larger (more positive). You can assume all attributes
use positive values unless stated otherwise.

Attributes are sorted based on their resolver - this has minor implications on calculation order,
but can usually be ignored.

Note that this list is not exhaustive, but should cover everything present in the current guides.

Also see the [Accuracy Mechanics](/accuracy/) page for a more detailed overview of the various
accuracy attributes (including how Hyperion works), and the [Melee Damage](/melee/) page for how the
various melee attributes are combined.
