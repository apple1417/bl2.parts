description: All attributes that item parts boost, and their effects.

# Attribute Reference
This page lists all the attributes that the various part pages refer to, what they control, and what
exactly happens when a bonus makes their value larger (more positive). You can assume all attributes
use positive values unless stated otherwise.

Any attributes which are said affect something "multiplicatively" have a base value of 1, and
directly multiply the relevant stat.

Note that this list is not exhaustive, but should cover everything present in the current guides.

Also see the [Accuracy Mechanics](/accuracy/) page for a more detailed overview of the various
accuracy attributes (including how Hyperion works), and the [Melee Damage](/melee/) page for how the
various melee attributes are combined.
