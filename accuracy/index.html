    <h1>BL2/TPS Accuracy Mechanics</h1>
    <div class="text">
        Accuracy is actually a bit more complicated than you might think.
        <br>
        <h3>Basics</h3>
        When you fire a shot, the direction of each projectile is picked in two passes.
        First, the game picks a general direction for the "cluster" of bullets to go, then each individual projectile gets it's own offset from that.
        Weapons with custom spread patterns may ignore the second pass.
        <br>
        As you fire your shots get more inaccurate - this is done by increasing your "cluster range".
        Your cluster range rests at a base value normally, but is then increased up to a maximum when you shoot.
        As it gets bigger, your shots can fire further and further out.
        On idle you will naturally regen back towards the base value, so once you stop shooting you eventually get back to normal.
        <br>
        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        Accuracy is controlled by six attributes, listed below alongside with their effect when increased.
        <table class="left">
            <tr>
                <th>Weapon Spread</th>
                <td>Increases the offset range for each individual projectile, decreasing overall accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Min Accuracy</th>
                <td>Increases the minimum cluster range, the most accurate you can ever be, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Max Accuracy</th>
                <td>Increases the maximum cluster range, the least accurate you can ever be, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Accuracy Regen</th>
                <td>Decreases how quickly the cluster range recovers after each shot, decreasing accuracy. This is a negative value.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Impulse Accuracy</th>
                <td>Increases the amount the cluster range grows each time you shoot, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Burst Impulse</th>
                <td>Increases the amount the cluster range grows each time you burst fire, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        The accuracy stat on the weapon card is controlled by weapon spread.
        Crosshair size is controlled by a combination of the weapon spread and the current cluster range.
        Weapon sway is controlled by the current cluster range.
        Recoil is controlled by impulse accuracy or burst impulse, based on how you're firing.
        <br>
        It is possible to get weapons where the min accuracy is greater than the max.
        When this happens the cluster range simply stays constant.
        <br>
        <h3>Hyperion</h3>
        Hyperion guns gain their special effect simply by inverting impulse accuracy and accuracy regen - impulse will be a negative value and regen will be a positive.
        When you equip a gun the game essentially pre-regenerates the accuracy, so you'll start at the max accuracy.
        As impulse accuracy is negative, each shot decreases the cluster range, increasing accuracy until you reach the min.
        Then on idle the positive accuracy regen will increasing the cluster range back to the maximum.
        <br>
        Grades are always set up to invert these attributes properly.
        Raw attribute effects may not be, so may give the opposite effect on Hyperion guns to others.
