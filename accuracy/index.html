    <h1>BL2/TPS Accuracy Mechanics</h1>
    <div class="text">
        Accuracy is actually a bit more complicated than you might think.
        <br><br>
        When you fire a shot, the direction of each projectile is picked in two passes.
        First, the game picks a general direction for the "cluster" of bullets to go, then each individual projectile gets it's own offset from that.
        Weapons with custom spread patterns may ignore the second pass.
        <br>
        As you fire your shots get more inaccurate - this is done by increasing your "cluster range".
        Your cluster range rests at a base minimum value normally, but is then increased when you shoot, up to a maximum.
        As it gets bigger, your shots fire further and further out.
        You will naturally regen back towards the base value, so when you stop shooting you quickly get back to normal.
        Hyperion weapons have this all inverted of course, they start at a max, lower to a min (getting more accurate), and regen upwards.
        Almost all bonuses take this into account though, you can just consider them to be normal guns.
        <br><br>
        Accuracy is controlled by six attributes, listed below alongside with their effect when increased.
        <table class="left">
            <tr>
                <th>Weapon Spread</th>
                <td>Increases the offset range for each individual projectile, decreasing overall accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Min Accuracy</th>
                <td>Increases the minimum cluster range, the most accurate you can ever be, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Max Accuracy</th>
                <td>Increases the maximum cluster range, the least accurate you can ever be, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Accuracy Regen</th>
                <td>Increases how quickly the cluster range recovers after each shot, increasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Impulse Accuracy</th>
                <td>Increases the amount of the cluster range grows each time you shoot, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <th>Burst Impulse</th>
                <td>Increases the amount of the cluster range grows each time you burst fire, decreasing accuracy.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        The accuracy stat on the weapon card is controlled by weapon spread.
        Crosshair size is controlled by a combination of the weapon spread and the current cluster range.
        Weapon sway is controlled by the current cluster range.
        Recoil is controlled by impulse accuracy and burst impulse, based on how you're firing.
