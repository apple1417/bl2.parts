    <h1>BL2/TPS Grenade Parts Guide</h1>
    <div class="text">
        Grenades are made up of up to 10 different parts.
        Unfortunately only 5 of these have models, all of which overlap, and it isn't even possible to tell between every version of each of them visually.
        <br>
        This page just goes over the visual parts, and what you can tell from them.
        A full, in-depth guide to all parts and how exactly they affect stats can be found <a href="full">here</a>
        <br>
        The visible parts are as follows:
        <br>
        <table><tr>
            <th>Material</th><th>Blast Radius</th><th>Child Count</th><th>Delivery</th>
            <th>Trigger</th>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\parts\material.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\parts\radius.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\parts\child.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\parts\delivery.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\parts\trigger.png"></td>
        </tr></table>
        <h3>Material</h3>
        The material depends entirely on the grenade's manufacture and rarity.
        Manufacturer changes the model, rarity changes the skin.
        <br>
        There are two unique materials, for the Data Scrubber and the Meganade.
        These share Maliwan's model, but use custom skins.
        <br>
        Torgue materials are the only ones to provide a stat bonus, they all have +2 child grenades.
        <table><tr>
            <th>Bandit</th><th>Dahl</th><th>Hyperion</th><th>Maliwan</th>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\bandit.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\dahl.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\hyperion.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\maliwan.png"></td>
        </tr></table>
        <table><tr>
            <th>Tediore</th><th>Torgue</th><th>Vladof</th>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\tediore.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\torgue.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\materials\vladof.png"></td>
        </tr></table>
        <img class="med right" src="images\radius.png">
        <h3>Blast Radius</h3>
        There are four possible blast radius parts: small, normal, large, and extra large.
        <br>
        There is only one model between them however, the large and extra large parts use the model shown on the right.
        <br>
        Because this model is shared the only way to tell which part exactly a particular grenade has is through its stats.
        <br>
        <img class="med right" src="images\child.png">
        <br>
        <h3>Child Count</h3>
        There are seven possible child count parts, with bonuses from +0 to +6 extra child grenades.
        <br>
        Again there is only one model, the +4 to +6 parts all share the one shown on the right.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Delivery</h3>
        There are seven standard delivery parts.
        <br>
        There are only three different models however, because the lobbed delivery doesn't have a model, and because sticky deliveries share the model of their base version.
        <br>
        The standard deliveries provide minor changes to fuse time.
        Check the full guide for more info.
        <table><tr>
            <th>Homing</th><th>Longbow</th><th>Rubberized</th>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\deliveries\homing.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\deliveries\longbow.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\deliveries\rubberized.png"></td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\deliveries\parts\homing.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\deliveries\parts\longbow.png"></td>
            <td><img class="med" src="images\deliveries\parts\rubberized.png"></td>
        </tr></table>
        There are two unique deliveries with models, the Contraband Sky Rocket uses the "high blast radius" model, and the x4 Magic Missile uses the "high child count" model
        <br>
        Neither of these grenades can spawn with the other parts that share their model.
        <br>
        <img class="med right" src="images\trigger.png">
        <br>
        <h3>Trigger</h3>
        There are six possible trigger parts.
        <br>
        The perfect (lowest fuse) part is the only one with a model, shown on the right.
