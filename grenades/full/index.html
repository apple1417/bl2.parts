    <h1>BL2/TPS Grenade Parts Guide (Full)</h1>
    <div class="text">
        This guide covers all grenade parts in-depth, and assumes you have read the base guide <a href="/bl2/grenades/">here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are two important concepts that are going to be used here a lot:
        <br>
        <br>
        Firstly, the general formula for all stat bonuses is as follows:
        <br>
        <code>
            FINAL = (BASE + <span class="preAdd">PreAdd</span>) &times;
            (1 + <span class="scale">Positive Scale</span>)&divide;(1 - <span class="scale">Negative Scale</span>)
            + <span class="postAdd">PostAdd</span>
        </code>
        <br>
        All bonuses in a specific category are added together before being applied.
        <br>
        <br>
        The other concept is grades.
        Grades are simply an easy way to have multiple ranks of bonuses for different parts.
        They are still categorised into one of the three bonus types mentioned above.
        A grade bonus will be defined by both its base and per-grade value.
        <br>
        <code>
            BONUS = BASE + PERGRADE&times;<span class="grade">Grades</span>
        </code>
        <br>
        All grades from all parts are added up before being applied.
        This matters for scale bonuses, where a positive base and negative per-grade value will eventually change the scale to a negative one, or vice versa.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Material</h3>
        As mentioned in the basic guide, the only materials with stat bonuses are the Torgue ones, which provide <span class="grade">+2</span> child count grades.
        <br>
        The Anemone DLC added exact copies of all base materials, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Blast Radius</h3>
        The blast radius parts have grades ranging from <span class="grade">-1</span> to <span class="grade">+2</span>.
        <br>
        The base blast radius is 580, and each grade adds a further 120.
        <br>
        The Anemone DLC added exact copies of all blast radius parts, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Child Count</h3>
        The child count parts' grades corrolate directly to the amount of extra child grenades.
        The parts have grades ranging from <span class="grade">0</span> to <span class="grade">+6</span>, and add from 0 to 6 extra child grenades.
        <br>
        The base child grenade count is 0, and each grade adds +1.
        <br>
        The Anemone DLC added exact copies of all child count parts, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Delivery</h3>
        Ignoring how the grenade is actually thrown, standard deliveries only affect the fuse time's grade and scale.
        Unique deliveries mostly only affect damage and blast radius.
        <br>
        A full list of deliveries and their stats is available <a href="/bl2/grenades/deliveries">here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Trigger</h3>
        The trigger parts have grades ranging from <span class="grade">-1</span> to <span class="grade">+4</span>.
        <br>
        The base fuse time is 0.6s, and each grade increases it by 0.6.
        <br>
        The Anemone DLC added exact copies of all trigger parts, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Accessory</h3>
        The accessories define both the element of the grenade and the (unlisted) status effect chance.
        This chance is per hit, so grenades that hit multiple times like teslas are much more likly to apply a DoT.
        <br>
        Each element has five accessories at different grades, and there's also an additional accessory for explosive.
        <br>
        The Anemone DLC added exact copies of all accessories, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        The Monster Trap has the only other unique accessory.
        It provides no stat bonuses, and is actually non-elemental, depite being displayed as explosive on the card.
        <br>
        The first grade of an accessory just enables that element, all others provide the following bonus:
    </div>
    <table><tr>
        <th class="fire">Fire</th><th class="shock">Shock</th>
        <th class="corrosive">Corrosive</th><th class="slag">Slag</th><th class="cryo">Cryo</th>
    </tr><tr>
        <td class="scale">+13%/g</td>
        <td class="scale">+13%/g</td>
        <td class="scale">+11.5%/g</td>
        <td class="scale">+15%/g</td>
        <td class="scale">+10%/g</td>
    </tr></table>
    <div class="text">
        As there are no explosive DoTs, there is only one grade of explosive accessory, which has no bonus status effect chance.
        <br>
        Status Effect Chance is comprised of two values, the base and multiplier.
        On grenades the base chance is always 1, only the muliplier is modified.
        The final chance will multiply the base value with the multiplier and one of the following values, based on element and enemy type.
        <br>
        Note that the card will use the generic value.
    </div>
    <table><tr>
        <th>Enemy Type</th><th class="fire">Fire</th><th class="shock">Shock</th>
        <th class="corrosive">Corrosive</th><th class="slag">Slag</th><th class="cryo">Cryo</th>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>Generic</td><td>20%</td><td>20%</td><td>20%</td><td>30%</td><td>15%</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>Flesh</td><td>30%</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td><td>30%</td><td>15%</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>Armor</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td><td>30%</td><td>30%</td><td>15%</td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td>Shield</td><td>15%</td><td>75%</td><td>15%</td><td>30%</td><td>5%</td>
    </tr></table>
    <div class="text">
        <h3>Damage</h3>
        There are eight possible damage parts, with grades from <span class="grade">0</span> to <span class="grade">+7</span>.
        These parts add <span class="scale">+0.03/g</span> bonus damage.
        <br>
        The seraph grenades all use their own damage parts.
        These parts have the exact same stats as standard ones of the same grade, they just don't overwrite the rarity.
        <br>
        Similarly, the Anemone DLC also added exact copies of all damage parts, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        The base damage, before anything is added or multipled is based entirely on the grenade's level.
        Unfortuantly the exact formula changes slightly depending on game, but it can be worked out as follows:
    </div>
        <table><tr>
            <th>BL2</th><th>TPS</th>
        </tr><tr>
            <td><code>100&times;(1.13^level)</code></td>
            <td><code>100&times;(1.10^level)</code></td>
        </tr></table>
    <div class="text">
        <h3>Payload</h3>
        The payload controls what exactly happens when the grenade explodes.
        It also provides some stat bonuses.
        <br>
        There are six standard payloads:
        <br>
        Area Effect, Bouncing Betty, MIRV, Singularity, Standard, and Transfusion
        <br>
        In the Pre Sequel there is an additional version of each of these payloads that can shatter air masks, but otherwise share all the same stats as their base versions.
        There are also several unique payloads in both games.
        <br>
        Payloads are also what's used to enable child grenades, even with several bonuses no child grenades will spawn if the payload is incorrect.
        All payloads with a child grenade count value enable them, even if that value is 0.
        <br>
        A full list of payloads and their stats is available <a href="/bl2/grenades/payloads/">here</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Status Effect Damage</h3>
        There are six possible status effect damage parts, with grades from <span class="grade">0</span> to <span class="grade">+5</span>.
        These parts affect all elements except <span class="slag">slag</span> and <span class="explosive">explosive</span>.
        <br>
        The base status effect damage is always 20% of the grenade's base damage (see the damage section).
        <br>
        Each grade adds a set percentage of the base status effect damage, based on element:
    </div>
    <table><tr>
        <th class="fire">Fire</th><th class="shock">Shock</th>
        <th class="corrosive">Corrosive</th><th class="cryo">Cryo</th>
    </tr><tr>
        <td class="preAdd">+5%/g</td>
        <td class="preAdd">+7%/g</td>
        <td class="preAdd">+6%/g</td>
        <td class="preAdd">+5%/g</td>
    </tr></table>
    <div class="text">
        The Anemone DLC added exact copies of all status effect damage parts, with the exact same stat bonuses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Grenade Definition</h3>
        Also known as "Type" in gibbed.
        <br>
        The grenade definition can be thought of as a prototype for each grenade.
        It not only defines the parts each grenade can use, but also the base stats, and how different grades affect them.
        <br>
        So far everything on this page has come from the "Standard" definiton, which all non-unique grenades use.
        Generally a lot of the stats are the same across definitions, so these numbers are usually correct, but some are overwritten in unique definition.
        <br>
        A full list of definitions and their stats is available <a href="/bl2/grenades/definitions/">here</a>
